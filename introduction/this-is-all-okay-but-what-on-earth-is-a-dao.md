In the world of web3, they say if 2021 was the year of NFTs, 2022 will be the year of DAOs. So better be prepared for it and start with what a DAO even is.

**A DAO is often described as sort of a ‚ÄúReddit community with a bank account.**

> It's **Decentralised** in nature, meaning no individual singlehandedly takes a decision.

>It's **Autonomous in nature**, meaning it has its own set of pre-decided rules and is usually backed by a smart contract and a treasury to function.

>It's an **Organisation**, just like conventional organisations and companies, people come together with different expertise and work towards a common objective.

DAOs are posed to change the way people work at organisations forever. No CVs required, no interviews, and no permissions. If you have Proof of Work, you can start working and also start earning.
