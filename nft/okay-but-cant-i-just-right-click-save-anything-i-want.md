**Well, you could, but that's not the point.**

A good way to wrap your head around this common question is to think about the number of posters of the Mona Lisa or the Starry Night that float around in the world. They're all showing the same image, but they're not worth hanging in the Louvre.

The authenticity of the original art piece remains true in the physical world, and NFTs make it possible to apply that concept in the digital realm as well.

Being on the blockchain, owning an NFT gives you provable ownership of the original piece so no matter how many times someone else right click, save as's your piece, it will still remain yours to keep.

Not to mention, NFTs offer myriad utilities on top of them as well. They're scarce, multi-dimensional and will remain permanently on the blockchain if you let them. You cannot Right Click, Save As that.
